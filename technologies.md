# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas in Jupyter Notebook will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. MatPlotLib will be used to visualize the dataset to assist in our exploratory analysis.

## Database Storage
The cleaned data will be saved in csv files and will be imported to Postrgres.

## Machine Learning
We will use SciKitLearn and ExponentialSmoothing from StatsModels to create our models and to predict our "what if" data.

## Dashboard
We will use Tableau to visualize our data and to create a dashboard.

Final group project

We plan to explore the relationship between food & gas prices and are going to use a machine learning model to examine what might have been. 
We'll look to see what our model predicts food and gas prices at had Covid-19 not disrupted the world in 2020.

We'll then compare the prediction to the actual data to see how far off the results were.

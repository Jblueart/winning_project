# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas in Jupyter Notebook will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. MatPlot Lib will be used to visualize the dataset before analysis.

## Database Storage
We will use Postrgres to store our data.

## Machine Learning
We will use SciKitLearn and ExponentialSmoothing to create our models and to predict our "what if" data.

## Dashboard
We will use Tableau to visualize our data and to create a dashboard.

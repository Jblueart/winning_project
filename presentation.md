## Topic
What would food and gas prices be like in the years 2020-2022 (and beyond) if Covid-19 and the war between Ukraine and Russia didn't happen?

We picked this topic because world-wide events have changed our lives in an unprecedented way. This change is hard to quantify or to conceptualize. Exploring food and gas prices is one way for us to try to quantify the effect that Covid-19 and the war between Ukraine and Russia has had and has on our daily lives. 

## Data
We will use two set of data from Kaggle.com:

"Food Prices in US Cities" documents the CPI for food monthly from 1952 to July 2022.

"US Gasoline and Diesel Retail Prices" documents the prices for various types of gas weekly from 1995 to January 2021.

## What We Hope to Answer with the Data

We hope to answer the question: what would gas prices and food prices be like if the years 2020-2022 had been "normal" and rather uneventful on a worldly scale?

We also hope to explore the relationship between gas and food prices.
